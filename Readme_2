Leveraging AI for Faster and Efficient Clinical Trials with a Focus on High Drop Rate

Clinical trials are a cornerstone of medical research, yet they often face significant challenges such as long durations, high costs, and a frequent issue of participant dropout. These dropouts not only delay the progress of promising treatments but also increase operational burdens and compromise the integrity of the data.

This project aims to explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve clinical trial efficiency by:
Predicting dropout risks
Identifying root causes
Providing smart recommendations to retain participants


Prediction Methodology
To achieve the aim of this project, a dataset containing the below details will be required;
Participant_ID – Unique code for each person
Age, Gender, Country – Basic details
Trial_Phase – Phase of the trial (1 to 4)
Treatment_Type – Which drug/treatment they're getting
Side_Effects_Severity – Mild / Moderate / Severe
Missed_Appointments – How many times they missed a check-in
Satisfaction_Score – From 1 to 10 (how happy they are)
Dropped_Out – Yes or No (did they quit the trial?)
Possible Dropout Reasons for participants who dropped out - Severe Side Effects /Couldn’t travel to location / Personal health issue

Recommendations to Reduce Drop-out and Improve Trial Design
The below dataset can be generated to recommend actions for participants at risk of dropping out;
Risk_Level & Recommended_Action
High - Increase support, offer transport, monitor side effects weekly
Medium - Weekly check-ins, increase satisfaction
Low- Maintain current engagement
